Ex 1.1.
Few concepts of my own interest are:
    
    machine learning : this is for extracting learning and information from data. We use optimisation algorithme for that.
    network: about modeling graph algorithm, and extract learning from it
    evolution and adaptation: modeling the evolution of population study and we can know how they behave with some parametre.
    game theory: this is about how can we be rational during descision making
