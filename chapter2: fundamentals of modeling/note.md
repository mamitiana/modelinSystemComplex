A model is simplified representation of a system. It can be conceptual , verbal , diagrammatic , physical or formal math.
Note: It is then from idea to paper . we are always creating a model of something in our mind.

Descriptive modeling: from data and equations , we will describe the state of the system . " what the system look like" 

Rule base modeling: from observation of the behavior of the system. We create dyanamical rules (equation , theories, principes). By doing that we can see how the system evolve.

## Modeling Complex Systems
1. What are the key questions you want to address?
2. to answer those questions, at what scale shoule you descripe  the behaviois of the system components. (microscopic or macro ... the scale levl)
3- how is the system stuctured ? how the intearct each other
4. what are the possible state of the system
5 how does it change over the time?  is it evolving by itself or from mutual interaction. 

A good model is simple , valid and robust

Ptolemy : simple, valid, not robust
Copernic: simple , valid , robust
Kepler: simple , valid , robust
Newtons : not realy simple, valid, robust
