Dynamical system theory: system that change over the time.
example: growth, pendulum, behavior of pepole during negotiation

$ x(t) = F(x(t-1) , t ) $


    population growth : x is the number of population at give t
    swinging pendulum: x is the position of the pendulum
    motions of celestial bodies: x is the position
    behavior on negotiation game: x is state is from [bad situation to favorable ] probabilies for example.
